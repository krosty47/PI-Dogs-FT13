# Dog App
To prove my hability on the following technologies:
- React
- Redux
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- Sequelize

I've created this application using data from [TheDogApi](https://docs.thedogapi.com/ "Dog Api").

To run the application:

- Firstly, in the project directory go to the 'Api' folder and run the following commands:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

- Secondly, open another terminal and in the project directory go to the 'client' folder and run the following commands again:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

-Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

As always, feel free to reach out for any suggestions!
