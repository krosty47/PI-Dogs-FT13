# Dog App
To test my habilities with the following technologies:
- React
- Redux
- Express
- PostgreSQL
- Sequelize

I've created this application using data from [TheDogApi](https://docs.thedogapi.com/ "Dog Api").

To run the application:

- First, at 'Api' folder run the following commands:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

- Second, open another terminal and  go to 'client' folder and run again:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

-Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view at browser.

Feel free to reach me out for any suggestions!
